EDSPERT ECOMMERCE PROJECT  
This project was initially created for learning purpose after finished my course at Edspert Indonesia.
The initial project was only for the `catalogue` and `course-details` pages only.
But after the deadline, I willingly dedicated my times to develop more pages on this project.
Up until present, the project is still under development, and there may be some changes in the future.  
DISCLAIMER: This project is made for portfolio purpose only.

There are 2 branches in this repository:
- one is `master` branch, which was made for directory views purpose.
- another is `hosting` branch, which was made for hosting on github.

You can open the github-hosted version on [https://arrengavriel.github.io/Edpsert-Project/](url)

More details:
- The bootstrap frontend framework included via CDN on [https://getbootstrap.com/](url)
- The responsive version of this project is yet to come, and still under development.
- Same way with responsive version, the integration with backend will be updated soon. And will be using the PHP-Laravel framework, since I'm only familiar with Laravel MVC model.
